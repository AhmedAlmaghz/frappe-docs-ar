## Payouts

For Marketplace apps that are non-free, we do a payout to the publisher at the **end of every month**. The payout contains all the payments we have collected from the customers over that month.

## Setup Payout Preferences

If you want to publish a paid app, please visit the **Publisher Profile** page and edit your payout preferences:

> If you are based from outside India, the only option available as of now is Paypal. You need to raise an PayPal invoice at the end of the month.

## Payout Orders

You can visit the **Payouts** page from your Developer dashboard to see the history of payouts with an option to view more details. A payout is in draft mode until the payment is processed from our side:

## Payout Terms

Frappe Cloud takes the first $500 of the revenue the app makes. After that the payment will be split 80-20, where 80% will go to you and 20% to Frappe Cloud.
