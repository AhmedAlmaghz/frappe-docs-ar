## Updating a Bench

You will see an update banner on your bench dashboard whenever an update is available for any of the apps installed on that bench:

Clicking on the **Show Updates** button will open up a dialog box where you can choose which apps to update (yes, we do have selective app updates!). Deselect the apps you don't want to update and click **Deploy**:

You can monitor the progress of your deploy in the **Deploys** tab:
