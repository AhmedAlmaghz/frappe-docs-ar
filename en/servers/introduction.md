## Introduction

With Servers on Frappe Cloud you now get dedicated compute resources for your sites.

Servers on Frappe Cloud come in pairs (Application + Database), both the servers can have different plan/size, however both are created within the same region.

Since you're paying for the servers, sites on these servers don't cost you anything extra. That means you can run as many sites and benches as you want on these servers.

All other features like [Private Benches](https://frappecloud.com/docs/benches), [SSH Access](https://frappecloud.com/docs/ssh), Database Access work as is with servers. All Frappe Cloud servers are powered by AWS (Amazon Web Services) EC2 instances.
