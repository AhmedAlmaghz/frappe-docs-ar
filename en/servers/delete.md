## Delete Servers

Deleting a server will delete both the application and the database server immediately. Be careful when deleting servers since you can **NOT** recover a server after deleting it.

> Note: You must delete all sites and benches before deleting the server.

Go to the Server Overview tab and find the Server Info card.

Click on Drop Server. ![Delete Server](https://frappecloud.com/files/delete-server.png)
