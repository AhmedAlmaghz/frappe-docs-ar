## Jobs

Jobs show a history of actions performed on your site.

1.  Every action such as site creation, adding a custom domain, scheduling a backup, updating site configuration, etc. is tracked here. For e.g.,
    
    *   Creating a new site
    *   Updating a site
    *   Installing apps on site
    *   Taking a backup of site
2.  You can view this data to see if the jobs are running properly, something is stuck, or has failed.
    
3.  Some successful jobs will show the command line output when the job was run.
