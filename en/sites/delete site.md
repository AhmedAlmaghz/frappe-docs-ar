## Delete Site

Deleting a site will archive the site immediately, so you cannot access it's backup files after that. So if you want to restore it, make sure to take a backup and download it.

1.  Go to the Site Overview tab and find the **Sites Info** card.
2.  Be careful when dropping sites since you can NOT recover a site once you drop it.
3.  Click on Drop Site.
4.  Type the site name to confirm this action.
5.  Click on Drop Site.
